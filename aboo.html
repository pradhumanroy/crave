It's the virtual equivalent of a physical store, offering a way to browse, purchase, and pay for goods and services without the need for a physical location. E-commerce websites facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers, enabling businesses to reach a wider audience and customers to access a global marketplace. </b></p></b></h1></body></html>
